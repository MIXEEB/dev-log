  <h2>Solving the Mystery of Failed Transactions in MiniatureTrading</h2>

  <h1></h1>
  <p>
  In my journey of working with the MiniatureTrading smart contract and the associated web application, I recently encountered an unexpected challenge. It was the perfect time to add a minting function to my project. However, things took an interesting turn when I attempted to mint new tokens and found myself facing the dreaded "Transaction Failed" error. In this dev-log, I'll take you through my experience, from the issue itself to the workaround, debugging, and my plans for further action.

  Everything seemed ready for minting. I had successfully deployed the MiniatureTrading smart contract and had implemented a web application for interacting with it. The minting function code appeared fine. However, a quick double-check of the documentation revealed a peculiar issue - the absence of data in the mint transaction. When I initiated the minting process, my expectations were met with disappointment as the transaction failed.
