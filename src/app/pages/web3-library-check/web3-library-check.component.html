  <h2>Solving the Mystery of Failed Transactions in MiniatureTrading</h2>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
  In my journey of working with the MiniatureTrading smart contract and the associated web application, I recently encountered an unexpected challenge.It was the perfect time to add a minting function to my project. However, things took an interesting turn when I attempted to mint new tokens and found myself facing the dreaded "Transaction Failed" error. In this dev-log, I'll take you through my experience, from the issue itself to the workaround, debugging, and my plans for further action.

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
  Everything seemed ready for minting. I had successfully deployed the MiniatureTrading smart contract and had implemented a web application for interacting with it. The minting function code appeared fine.

    However, a quick double-check of the documentation revealed a peculiar issue - the absence of data in the mint transaction. When I initiated the minting process, my expectations were met with disappointment as the transaction failed.

  <h3>Workaround</h3>
  <p>
  In the world of blockchain development, Etherscan is your trusty companion when you're stuck with transaction failures. I eagerly dove into Etherscan to compare the data sent by my web app with that generated by Remix IDE, only to find a stark difference. The data field was empty, showing nothing but "0x."

  Determined to get my miniatures minted, I took a raw approach, manually specifying the data in the transaction. This approach worked, but it left me pondering: why resort to such a blunt method when I had a neat contract object at my disposal? The solution was clear â€“ modifying the transaction options and explicitly adding data with encodeABI. As intended, the gallery was soon filled with the eagerly awaited miniatures.
